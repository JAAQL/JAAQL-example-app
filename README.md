# JAAQL-example-app
Welcome to the JAAQL example app. Here we import JAAQL and use it to produce a documented endpoint. We also create a new docker container. Please refer to https://github.com/JAAQL/JAAQL-middleware-python/blob/main/docker/docker.md on how to run this docker container  
If you are testing this yourself, you will need to run jaaql install before you call the hello world endpoint. This is because install sets up the logging tables
